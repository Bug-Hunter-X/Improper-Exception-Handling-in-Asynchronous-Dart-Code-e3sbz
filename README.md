# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository showcases a common error in Dart: improper exception handling within asynchronous functions. The example demonstrates a scenario where an exception is caught but not handled effectively, potentially leading to silent failures in the application.

The `bug.dart` file illustrates the flawed approach, while `bugSolution.dart` provides the corrected version with proper exception handling.

## Problem

The original code uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during an HTTP request. However, simply catching the exception and printing an error message is insufficient.  The `rethrow` statement is missing, preventing higher levels of the application from knowing about the failure and responding appropriately.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to effectively handle exceptions in asynchronous operations. The `rethrow` statement ensures that the exception propagates up the call stack, allowing for more robust error management.

The solution also includes more informative error handling in the `catch` block, providing more context about what went wrong.
